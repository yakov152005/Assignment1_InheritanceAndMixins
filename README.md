#  Assignment 1 – Object-Oriented Programming 2 (Inheritance and Mixins)
### Semester B • Second Year • College Project


##  Overview

This assignment contains two separate implementations demonstrating the use of inheritance and mixins in Java:

1. **Collins & Quillian Model** – A hierarchical conceptual model for object recognition using abstract classes and traits (interfaces).  
    Includes both **console-based** and **GUI-based** versions.

2. **Smart Home System** – A simulation of electronic devices categorized by room and functionality (e.g., audio, kitchen), controlled by a Smart Remote using mixins and inheritance.
